Ancestry is genetically inferred and specifies where each part of an individuals DNA likely originates from. Ancestry is a relative term to time, geography, reference data, and the methods used to estimate and infer ancestry. It is important to note that the conceptual frameworks used to estimate ancestry are based on assumptions of genetic homogeneity within ancestry groups and the ancestry groups considered tend to reflect the continents, which also correspond to racial categories.

Ancestry is a fluid concept, often invoked to approximate genomic background in research studies.Global ancestry is a framework for categorizing individuals into continental groups, based on a comparison of DNA from study subjects to "reference data" which are labelled by continent.

## Why do we care about this at GEL?

Modern populations and modern humans as a species all have a common origin on the continent of Africa. Therefore, ancestry at the time scale of more than 200.000 years makes little sense unless you can differentiate among populations in Africa.

At GEL, we commonly use continental ancestry categories to group genomes. However, the categories are not always precise: for example, the African category mainly consists of West African samples. This is problematic as it risks excluding someone with East African ancestry from being included in the dataset.

  ## In a genomics context
  An individual's ancestry is estimated by comparing their DNA to DNA from a curated set of labelled individuals used as reference data.. Since samples often are collected from one location and used to represent a whole continent, the method of estimating based on a curated set of data risk concluding flawed ancestries.

  <summary>What is the debate around this term?</summary>
  Some researchers urge geneticists to move away from continental ancestry categories (e.g. African, East Asian, South Asian, European and American) since a singular location-specific notion of ancestry bears resemblance to racial groupings and further overlooks that ancestry changes over time and varies within continental groups. Oftentimes, race and ancestry are conflated which leads scientists and clinicians to attribute differences in health to innate biology rather than to social inequality (Too many scientists still say Caucasian  by Alice Popejoy, 2021). Continental ancestry categories disregard diverse populations from around the world who can not be reasonably categorised within them, and merge large groups of people who are genetically diverse - such as people from Africa.

Always make it very specific what your query is, before conforming to continental ancestry groups.
