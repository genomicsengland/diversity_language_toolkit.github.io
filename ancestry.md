Ancestry is genetically inferred and specifies where each part of an individuals DNA likely originates from.

# Why do we care about this at GEL?

At GEL, we commonly use continental ancestry categories to group genomes. However, the categories are not always precise: for example, the African category mainly consists of West African samples. This is problematic as it risks excluding someone with East African ancestry from being included in the dataset.
