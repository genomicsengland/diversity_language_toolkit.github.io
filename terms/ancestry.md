**Ancestry is genetically inferred and specifies where each part of an individuals DNA likely originates from. Ancestry is a relative term to time, geography, reference data, and the methods used to estimate and infer ancestry. It is important to note that the conceptual frameworks used to estimate ancestry are based on assumptions of genetic homogeneity within ancestry groups and the ancestry groups considered tend to reflect the continents, which also correspond to racial categories.**


**Why do we care about this at GEL?**

At GEL, we commonly use continental ancestry categories to group genomes. However, the categories are not always precise: for example, the African category mainly consists of West African samples. This is problematic as it risks excluding someone with East African ancestry from being included in the dataset. 

Global, or continental, ancestry categories are imbalanced groupings that have no basis in population genetic theory. While some categories (e.g., European) may be more genetically homogeneous than others, there is still diversity within that category that is not represented. On the other end of the spectrum, nearly all global human genomic diversity is a subset of the diversity across the continent of Africa, where modern human populations have been evolving the longest. It is scientifically inaccurate to use these broad categories (historically rooted in racial hierarchies) as a means of accounting for genomic background, or population structure.

  <summary>Use in different contexts?</summary>
  
**In a genomics context**, 
   * An individual's ancestry is estimated by comparing their DNA to DNA from a curated set of labelled individuals used as reference data. Since samples often are collected from one location and used to represent a whole continent, the method of estimating based on a curated set of data risk concluding flawed ancestries.

**In an everyday context**, 
  * Ancestry can often refer to background, genealogy, ethnicity, culture and descent and can be used interchangeably in everyday life. For example, "I have Vietnamese ancestry" could refer to ethnographic and cultural factors you inherit from your family, and not what your ancestry looks like in your genes once it has been analysed.

  <summary>What is the debate around this term!</summary>
  
  Some researchers urge geneticists to move away from continental ancestry categories (e.g. African, East Asian, South Asian, European and American) since a singular location-specific notion of ancestry bears resemblance to racial groupings and further overlooks that ancestry changes over time and varies within continental groups. Oftentimes, race and ancestry are conflated which leads scientists and clinicians to attribute differences in health to innate biology rather than to social inequality (Too many scientists still say Caucasian  by Alice Popejoy, 2021). Continental ancestry categories disregard diverse populations from around the world who can not be reasonably categorised within them, and merge large groups of people who are genetically diverse - such as people from Africa.

  Always make it very specific what your query is, before conforming to continental ancestry groups.
