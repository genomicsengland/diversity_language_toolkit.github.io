Ancestry is genetically inferred and specifies where each part of an individuals DNA likely originates from.

**Why do we care about this at GEL?**

At GEL, we commonly use continental ancestry categories to group genomes. However, the categories are not always precise: for example, the African category mainly consists of West African samples. This is problematic as it risks excluding someone with East African ancestry from being included in the dataset.

**In a genomics context**, an individual's ancestry is estimated by comparing their DNA
  to DNA from a curated set of labelled individuals used as reference data.

**In an everyday context**, ancestry can often refer to background, genealogy, ethnicity, culture and descent and can be used interchangeably in everyday life. For example, "I have Vietnamese ancestry" could refer to ethnographic and cultural factors you inherit from your family, and not what your ancestry looks like in your genes once it has been analysed.
