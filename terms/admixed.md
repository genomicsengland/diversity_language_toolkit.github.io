### Why do we care about this at GEL

Admixed populations are formed through the exchange of DNA between two or more populations who were previously isolated from one another over several generations. Admixed individuals can trace their ancestry back to multiple source populations.

### What this means for a non-genetic audience

Most genome samples will include some degree of admixture and admixture does not translate into race or ethnicity.


### Case Study

<details>
  <summary>Why is this a problem in a genomics context?</summary>

  Admixed individuals are often lumped together in surveys as one group when in fact they span vast variety. Because of the difficulty of labelling admixed samples, they are sometimes left out of statistics, and end up in 'unassigned' categories.

  The division lines between population data are somewhat arbitrary. Data points are plotted into clusters and those too close to the dividing line are not included because they cannot be confidently classified into one or the other cluster. This reinforces the false notion of "pure" or "isolated" populations that are genetically homogeneous, because most who fill in the spectrum of diversity have been excluded from studies.
